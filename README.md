# DECISION-TREE-AND-SUPPORT-VECTOR-MACHINE

Project details:

This project aims to help gain hands-on experience by developing and applying appropriate machine
learning models.Assess the correct
application of the respective machine learning technique and the interpretion of the results obtained is done.
Highlight the difference between the below machine Learning techniques by proper understanding of
the dataset and code.

1. Decision tree model with entropy implementation
   
2. Adaboost
  
3. Multiclass SVM
   
Dataset:

Title: Communities and Crime

Abstract: The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from
the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. The crime dataset contains 128
socio-economic features from the US 1990 Census. The target is the crime rate per community.

Number of Instances: 1994, Number of Attributes: 128

Using the Dataset:

1. Identify the variables that are the most highly correlated with the target
   
2. Apply either dimensionality reduction or feature selection on the dataset
   
3. Evaluate multiple algorithms i.e, the algorithms which are mentioned above to predict the crime
   
rate.
4. Compare the performance of each model & identify the best performing one.
   
5. Present how your model generalizes and performs on unseen data.
